# **HANDWRITTEN DIGITS RECOGNITION USING CNN**

## **0. Introduction**

The **Handwritten Digits Recognition** problem is the one of classic problems in **Computer Vision** field. Nowaday, it still apply widely in many fields such as **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, banking, postal service, and others. In this project, we will use **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to solve this problem, this is special neural network structure is effective in processing and analysing image data.

The dataset used in this problem is **Modified National Institute Standards and Technology (MNIST)**, which stores handwritten digit images from 0 to 9. This dataset contains about 60,000 image for training set and 10,000 images for testing set, with each image size 28x28 pixels. Our goal that initialize a CNN model and train it using MNIST data, and enable it to predict accurately on the testing set.
