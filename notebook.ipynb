    "The **Handwritten Digits Recognition** problem is the one of classic problems in **Computer Vision** field. Nowaday, it still apply widely in many fields such as **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**, banking, postal service, and others. In this project, we will use **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to solve this problem, this is special neural network structure is effective in processing and analysing image data.\n",

This dataset contains about 60,000 image for training set and 10,000 images for testing set, with each image size 28x28 pixels. Our goal that initialize a CNN model and train it using MNIST data, and enable it to predict accurately on the testing set."
